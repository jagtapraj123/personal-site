# Intro

I am a graduate student at [Purdue University](https://www.cs.purdue.edu) purduing MS in Computer Science. Before Purdue, I graduated from [Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Goa](https://iitgoa.ac.in).

I have worked in the industry for almost 2 years. I was a Software Developer in [Wunderman Thompson Commerce](https://www.wundermanthompson.com), where I created ML tools for automated ads generation and business analysis tools to estimate sales, competitor analysis, predictions and SEO. I also worked in [Qualcomm](https://www.qualcomm.com) and [Arm](https://www.arm.com).

I am particularly interested in building user applications. If you think I can be helpful to you or your cause and would like to meet, please feel free to get in touch.
